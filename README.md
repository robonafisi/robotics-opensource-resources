# robotics-opensource-resources
The list of resources to get inspiration, ship fast, and keep up with the latest in robotics.

The repository is divided into the following sections:

- Opensource hardware
- ML/RL research papers
- Localisation/Navigation/SLAM software
- Other software

Let's make this a place where we can come back and expedite every building or learning sprint we are starting.
